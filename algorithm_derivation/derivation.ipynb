    "## Solution of sheared-ellipse equation, without computing square root \n",
    "\n",
    "To solve the ellipse equation $D(x,y)=0$ for plotting an ellipse in rasterised displays, and avoiding the square-root computation, for a given $y$ and trial $x_R$ value for a point on the right of the ellipse, if $x_R$ is a good solution then we should have $D(x_R+0.5,y)>0$ and $D(x_R-0.5,y)<0$. An equivalent condition holds for $x_L$ (but with reversed inequality signs).\n",
    "\n",
    "At $y=0$, we have $x_L=-A$ and $x_R=A$.  Then for a different value of $y$, such that $-B\\leq y\\leq B$, we can solve $x_R$ by iterating the following two steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If $D(x_R-0.5,y)>0$ then we are clearly too far outside the ellipse, and, provided $x_R>x_C$, then we can update $x_R \\leftarrow x_R-1$.\n",

    "2. If $D(x_R+0.5,y)<0$ then we are clearly too far inside the ellipse, or if $x_R<x_C$, then we should update $x_R \\leftarrow x_R+1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For any fixed $y$, we should keep applying the above two steps until no more changes to $x_R$ occur (i.e. until the above two steps converge).  At this time $x_R$ will be the correct $x$-coordinate for the right-hand side of the ellipse at the given $y$-coordinate.  (In step 1 above, the $x_R>x_C$ check is also needed, otherwise it is possible for the update $x_R \\leftarrow x_R-1$ to skip right over very narrow tall ellipses, thus passing into the left region outside of the ellipse with $D<0$, and therefore entering an infinite loop of repeatedly applying step 1.)\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve for $x_L$ at the given $y$, we iterate the following two steps until convergence:\n",
    "3. If $D(x_L+0.5,y)>0$ then we are clearly too far outside the ellipse, and, provided $x_L<x_C$, then we can update $x_L \\leftarrow x_L+1$.\n",

    "4. If $D(x_L-0.5,y)<0$ then we are clearly too far inside the ellipse, or if $x_L>x_C$, then  we should update $x_L \\leftarrow x_L-1$\n",

    "Hence we can solve the ellipse without using any explicit square-root computations.\n",

    "Note that in the above, to avoid having to repeatedly calculate $x\\pm 0.5$, it is preferable to redefine $D(x,y)=((x+0.5)B-yS)^2-A^2(B^2-y^2)$.  Also define $T=(x+0.5)B-yS$.  Then all occurrences of  $D(x+0.5,y)$ become $D(x,y)$, and all occurrences  of $D(x-0.5,y)$ become $D(x,y)+B^2-2BT$.  Hence, with further abbreviating of $D_L=D(x_L,y)$ etc, then steps 1-4 above change to the following:\n",
